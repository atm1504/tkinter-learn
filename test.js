<h3>Team DSC, IIT Patna </h3> <br>
wishes you all a very <br> 
<h1><b> Happy New Year! 2021!! </b></h1>

<pre>

We hope that 2021 fills everyone's lives with happiness and brings success and joy to all.

We all hope that things get back to normal and we get called to the campus soon.

2020 was a tough year indeed, but we made it to the end without giving up. The year taught us how important it is to come out of our comfort zones.
We adapted to the changes conducted many sessions online, be it guest lectures, fresher's introduction, online learning sessions, and what not!

Last but not the least, we applaud your patience and determination which you all managed to keep intact in such difficult times to finally break through all the hurdles and hardships to make way to an IIT 
(^_^)

Keep shining always;

PS: We have something exciting planned for you all. Tap on the link to know more
